## Frontend Homework

- As part of our application process, we'd like to see what you can produce by giving you a small assignment. It should take you no more than a few hours to complete the assignment, but any extra polish or features you might want to put in will not go unnoticed.

### The assignment

- We would like you to create an invoicing app. The features it should include:

- Create a new invoice, it could be any component that you think would be a good fit.✅
- Add line items to the invoice. Line items may include hours of work at a certain rate, work-related expenses, materials, labor, etc.✅
- Include a dropdown list on how to pay it, Visa or Debit, etc.✅
- Include Send button which could send the invoice via email (does not have to actually send emails, but if it does, great!) (las facturas están siendo grabadas en una base de datos de firebase) ✅
- View invoices including status (paid, outstanding, late, etc.)✅
- Your backend can be anything, and does not have to work. If you would like to use a mocked-out interface, that is fine (even static data in code is ok).✅

### Extra credit features

- Code structure✅
- Unit tests

### Description of what I did

- Implement the Firebase database to save the data and retrieve it dynamically, a header in which an authentication system could be created and save the invoices for each user separately and that each one has their data, a routing with the views to create, edit, see the list of invoices with actions such as edit, delete, view details and a detailed view with all the invoice data.
